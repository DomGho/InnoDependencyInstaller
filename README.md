<b>Introduction</b><br>
This 'archive' contains a modular InnoSetup install script that downloads (if setup files don't exist locally) and installs various dependencies like .NET Framework 1.1/2.0/3.5/4.0/4.6 or C++ Redistributable 2005/2008/2010/2012/2013/2015 on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

<b>Background</b><br>
Once upon a time, I needed an installer for my .NET applications. I knew that I could use the "genius" ClickOnce installer, but in my opinion it has a bad interface and is not very handy. Then I came across a script for InnoSetup that had everything I wanted, but unfortunately it was only for .NET 1.1. So, I spent quite a bit of time in InnoSetup to modify it to my needs and extending it vastly.
